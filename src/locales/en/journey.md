## The Care Pathway
- The process usually begins in the **general practitioner’s office and/or a specialized outpatient clinic**.  
- If the decision for surgery is made, ideally a **prehabilitation** follows first – a short-term intervention aimed at improving physical fitness and resilience before the procedure.  
- Well prepared, patients then undergo the **surgery**.  
- After the procedure, **rehabilitation** helps restore physical performance and independence.  
- Follow-up care usually takes place again in the **general practitioner’s office**.
