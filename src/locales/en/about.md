The [FFG](www.ffg.at) funded flagship project **Prehab2Rehab** investigates how people can be best supported along the entire care pathway â€“ before and after a planned surgery. The goal is to create an integrated, digitally supported, and individually tailored care that sustainably strengthens both patients and the healthcare system.

- Patients benefit from **better surgery preparation, fewer complications, and faster recovery**.  
- The healthcare system and society benefit from **shorter hospital stays, less follow-up care, faster return to work, and more healthy years of life**.
